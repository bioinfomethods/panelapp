# Local development environments

Local-dev uses Docker and the [Docker Compose stack](./docker-compose.yml) included
 
Docker Compose cluster includes:

* _Web_ component: a Django app server run with `runserver_plus`.
* _Worker_  component: a Celery application.
* A PostgreSQL instance
* [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), mocking S3 and SQS.
 
The application source code fis mounted rom the local machine as volumes into the running containers.
Any change to the code will be immediately reflected.

A [Makefile](./Makefile) helps with common development tasks.

> If you start the docker-compose cluster directly, without the Makefile, you need to set `TMPDIR` env variable. 
> To `/tmp/localstack` on Linux or `/private/tmp/localstack` on OSX.

## Developer machine requirements

Software requirements:

* Docker: tested with Docker v.18.09.2 on Mac
* AWS CLI: tested with aws-cli/1.16.156 Python/2.7.16 botocore/1.12.146

Local setup requirements:

* Edit your `/etc/hosts` file adding `localstack` as alias to `localhost`

This is required because [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), mocking AWS services, is running in
the Docker-Compose cluster as `localstack` but exposed to the host machine on localhost (port `4572` and `4576` for 
S3 and SQS, respectively).

## Dockerfiles

_Web_ and _Worker_ have separate Dockerfiles: [`Dockerfile-web`](./Dockerfile-web) and [`Dockerfile-worker`](./Dockerfile-worker).

All Python dependencies, including dev and test deps, are installed as editable.

## Development lifecycle

You should use the [Makefile](./Makefile) in this directory for all common tasks.


### Build dev docker images 

```bash
$ make build
```

### Run and setup the stack

To start an empty application from scratch (no Panel, but includes Genes data).

1. Start a new dev stack (in detached mode): 
    ```bash
    $ make up
    ```
2. Create db schema or apply migration (give few seconds to the db container to start, before running `migrate`): 
    ```bash
    $ make migrate
    ```
3. Load gene data: 
    ```bash
    $ make loaddata
    ```
    Genes data contains public gene info, such as ensemble IDs, HGNC symbols, OMIM ID.
4. Create all required mock AWS resources, if the do not exist:
    ```bash
    $ make mock-aws
    ```
5. Deploy static files:
    ```bash
    $ make collectstatic
    ```
6. Create admin user (username: `admin`, interactively insert password)
    ```bash
    $ make createsuperuser
    ```
    This is the user to log into the webapp.


### Developing and accessing the application

The application is available at `http://localhost:8080/`

The Python code is mounted from the host `<project-root>/panelapp` directory.  

**`setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in` and `VERSION` are copied into the container when the Docker image is build.**
Any change to these files (e.g. **changes to dependencies versions**) requires rebuilding the container and restarting 
the cluster.

* Run tests:
    ```bash
    $ make tests
    ```
* To tail logs from **all** containers:
    ```bash
    $ make logs
    ```
    To see logs from a single service you must use `docker-compose` or `docker` commands, directly.
* Stop the stack, without losing the state (db content):
    ```bash
    $ make stop
    ```
    Restart after stopping with `start`.
* Tear down the stack destroying the state (db content):
    ```bash
    $ make down
    ```
* The content of mock S3 buckets is actually saved in the temp directory (`/tmp/localstack` on Linux or 
    `/private/tmp/localstack` on OSX). When you re-create the cluster and `mock-aws` resources, content of S3 buckets will 
    be there. To clear them use:
    ```bash
    $ make clear-s3
    ```
* Run a Django arbitrary command:
    ```bash
    $ make command <command> [<args>...]
    ```
    E.g. to run shell_plus extension to debug models
    ```bash
    $ make command shell_plus

    ```

## Application Configuration

Django settings: [`panelapp.settings.docker-dev`](../../panelapp/panelapp/settings/docker-dev.py).

The [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) sets all required environment variables.

By default, it uses mocked S3 and SQS by LocalStack.

> You could run the application against RabbitMQ and the local file system, tweaking 
> [docker-dev settings](../../panelapp/panelapp/settings/docker-dev.py) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml),
> but this backward compatibility may be dropped in the future.

Sending email is completely disabled: it only outputs to console.

## LocalStack

The Docker-Compose cluster also includes an instance of [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) running 
S3, SQS for local development.

A minimal LocalStack UI is accessible from `http://localhost:8090/`

Service endpoints are LocalStack defaults:

* S3: `http://localhost:4572`
* SQS: `http://localhost:4576`


> If you are running Docker Compose directly (or from the IDE) on OSX, beware that requires the environment variable
> `TMPDIR=/private/tmp/localstack`. Failing to do this causes LocalStack mounting the host directory `/tmp/localstack` 
> (default on Linux), but Docker has no write access to `/tmp` on OSX. The symptom will be a number of *Mount denied* 
> or permissions errors on starting LocalStack.

### Differences between AWS LocalStack and real AWS services

* Running containers do not have any IAM Role; AWS credentials are not actually required but all libraries/cli tools 
    expect them. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` must be set as environment variables in the running
    container (actual values do not matter).
* [Service endpoints](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#user-content-overview) are different. 
    You have to pass `endpoint_url` to most of libraries/CLI commands. Also, you may have to disable `https` with
    `use_ssl=False` as LocalStack uses http while S3, for example, uses https by default.
* Containers running inside the docker-compose cluster see all LocalStack service coming from `localstack` host. From the
    host machine they are actually exposed to `localhost`. To make scripts running both inside the containers and from
    the host machine, set an alias `localstack` alias to `localhost` in the host machine's `/etc/hosts` file
* LocalStack SES does not support SMTP

### AWScli-local

It might be handy installing [AWScli-local](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local) on developer's machine.

It is a wrapper around AWS cli for interacting with LocalStack (it helps with not `--endpoint-url` and providing dummy 
credentials on every request).
