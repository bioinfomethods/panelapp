# Gunicorn configuration file
# Iterates through all env variables named GUNICORN_* and set local variables with the suffix, lowercased: e.g.
# GUNICORN_FOO_BAR = 42 creates a local variable named foo_bar with value '42'
# Inspired by: https://sebest.github.io/post/protips-using-gunicorn-inside-a-docker-image/
